# =============================================================================
# .claudeignore — Files Claude Code skips when auto-scanning the project
# =============================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT: This only affects automatic codebase scanning/indexing.
# Claude CAN still read any file if you explicitly ask it to (e.g., "read this PDF").
# Claude is multimodal and can read PDFs, images, etc. on demand.
#
# Purpose: Reduce context window usage and speed up responses by skipping
# files that are rarely useful during development conversations.
#
# Copy this file to the root of your project and customize as needed.

# =============================================================================
# NOT excluded (Claude can scan these):
# =============================================================================

# *.png/jpg — Screenshots, UI mockups (Claude is multimodal)
# *.svg     — Diagrams, icons (useful for understanding UI)
# *.jar     — Might need to inspect Bonita connector JARs
# *.war     — Might need to inspect Bonita deployments
